## 1.2. About <a name = "about"></a>

Finding class attributes can be time consuming and you only have the option of searching the config.cpp directly or using the ingame console (as far as I know).
Both ways can have their drawbacks. As I didn't want to switch ingame always and because this is needed for a future Project, I wanted to be able to easily access and find all attributes I need. Currently it just lists all display names, but the goal is a GUI to handle the config easily.

### 1.2.1. Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Armaclass module
```

## 1.3. Usage <a name="usage"></a>

currently only by installing the Armaclass python module, exchanging the paths in the main script and running it with python. easier use is coming!
